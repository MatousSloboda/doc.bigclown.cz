# BigClown Documentation


**Welcome to BigClown Documentation!**


The goal of this site ([doc.bigclown.com](https://doc.bigclown.com)) is to give you a close overview of our **home automation** platform.
We are constantly working on making it better and content gradually grows as we get younger every day. :-)


## Site Structure


We provide several layers in our documentation ecosystem:


* **Tutorials** to give you an idea about the system basics.

* **Projects** to inspire you what can be achieved with BigClown components.

* **Integrations** to show you how our open platform can play along with other technologies.

* **Reference** to give you a comprehensive guide throughout your development journey.

* **Academy** to teach you some general stuff about the technologies we use.
